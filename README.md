The title of this project is Project_Tziporah
Description:

This is a business webpage for Tziporah. Tziporah offers runes and tarot readings online.
The website was designed for use of Portuguese speaking individuals.
The Home page is a presentaton of the business owner.
For this project I chose to implement a simple hamburger menu using JavaScript for instances when the website is viewed through small screens such as in mobile devices.

The webpage 'Seu Signo' has a JavaScript feature which presents a persons birth sign and it's characteristics based on the day and month of birth entered on the form.

The webpage tarot presents 4 sample tarot cards. With the use of CSS features, the cards flip when the user(s) hover the cursor over them. The back of the cards then present a brief description of the meaning of that card when drawn in a consultation. 
Finally, I used the getFullYear function on the footer of the pages so that users can see the time and date when they are accessing the page.
